## PROJECT: BATTLESHIP

Project is a part of The Odin Project [JavaScript learning curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript). To learn more open the [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/battleship).

## Description

The Starships is a project for learning a little bit of **Test Driven Development** and enhancing skills in [React Framework](https://reactjs.org/). This app is not implementing testing the appearance of a webpage! Testing was done to logics. **Jest** was a tool to test js functions and objects like ships, game board & players. On further stages of developing this app I decided to add transitions from [React Transition Group](http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition).

On page load you can observe text flowing similarly to one from George Lukas Star Wars movies. If you are perceptive you will spot that stars in the background are glowing, due to the `night-sky` effect (simple css animations).

You can start the game by clicking the button on the bottom of the page. Or you can just enjoy looking on the x-wing!

Furtherly you are taken to the game preparations. Here you can place your fleet however you want, or.. just randomly. You are a good guy, **remember that**! Help the rebeliants to win!

Otherwise...
